## Loose Ideas

### Nothing here is final nor absolute

#### Curse

Create 2 loop walls and stick everyone to the ground

#### Boots

Bomb boots;

Double jump boots;

Bounce boots;

. . .

#### Toroidal justification

Our hero was cursed by a powerful wizard and is now stuck in between
illusionary walls that teleport him to the other wall.

#### Direction (up / down) justification

He is stuck in between the walls, the only ways he can go are Up or Down.
Down is blocked, so, Up it is.

#### Enemies

The wizard is afraid of him breaking free, so, blocks the path up with various
crazy enemies. The higher he goes, the tougher they are.

#### Plot Twist (?)

Down was the way.

### USP

Vertical Toroidal movement.
